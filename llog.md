### Today, I thought about primitive alternatives to `pbcopy`
If you're using OS X, you can move data from the terminal to the clipboard with 
the `pbcopy` command.  If you have X, you can use `xclip`.

A way that I like better is using temporary files:
- `date > /tmp/today.txt` Append some arbitrary data to a text file (instead of a clipboard).
- `vim some_file.txt` Edit an arbitrary file.
-  `:r /tmp/today.txt` Insert the data from the arbitary after the current cursorline.

Appending text may have been a more reasonable alternative:
`date >> some_file.txt`

### Today, I decided to start a blog in markdown, even if it is just local. 
I've decided to call it a "llog".

### Today, I firewalled a new server.
I mostly followed instructions here: https://www.linode.com/docs/security/securing-your-server
And then I skimmed some info from the arch wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/iptables
