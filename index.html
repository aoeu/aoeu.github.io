<h1>Hello there, stranger.</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>This is a log of things I learn, experiment with, or think about.</p>

<h2><a href="index.html#1485561815">•</a> 1485561815 - 20170127</h2>

<p>At the moment, certain computers have USB-C ports while many Android devices do not.<br />
In attempts to not carry around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C">USB-C</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors">USB-Micro-B </a> converters, I thought that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_software_development#ADB">Android Debug Bridge</a> tool might be a practical replacement when run in a <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#wireless">wireless mode</a> that utilizes TCP/IP.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>The dance to boostrasp a computer to use Android Debug Bridge to communicate wirelessly to an Android device (starting out connected via a USB cable, but unplugged after) seemed straight-ahead enough.<br />
I found that arbitrary pauses in between <code>adb</code> commands were required in order to allow the Android Debug Bridge server to restart or reconfigure:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
adb usb &amp;&amp; \
sleep 2 &amp;&amp; \
test `adb devices | wc -l` -gt 1 &amp;&amp; \
TCPIP_PORT=5555 &amp;&amp; \
sleep 2 &amp;&amp; \
adb tcpip $TCPIP_PORT &amp;&amp; \
sleep 2 &amp;&amp; \
DEVICE_IP=$(adb shell ip -f inet addr show wlan0 | grep inet | sed 's/^.*\([0-9]\{3\}\.[0-9]\{3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\)\/24.*$/\1/')  &amp;&amp; \
adb connect $DEVICE_IP:$TCPIP_PORT
</code></pre>

<p>I then found that transferring a 21 megabyte file proved to be relatiely slow:</p>

<pre><code>$ time adb install -r molasses.apk
[100%] /data/local/tmp/molasses.apk
    pkg: /data/local/tmp/molasses.apk
Success

real    3m40.721s
</code></pre>

<p>If doing the napkin-math correctly, that&rsquo;s a transfer rate of  approximately 0.763 megabits per second.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s also an order of magnitude (11 times) slower than installing the same file over USB:</p>

<pre><code>$ adb usb
restarting in USB mode
$ time adb install -r molasses.apk
[100%] /data/local/tmp/molasses.apk
	pkg: /data/local/tmp/molasses.apk
Success

real	0m19.989s
</code></pre>

<p>Technically, the wireless router could be part of the slow-down, but I doubt it.<br />
So, why is <code>adb</code> over TCP/IP so slow?</p>

<h2><a href="index.html#1485388140">•</a> 1485388140 - 20170125</h2>

<p>Today I learned that certain built-in shell commands, such as <code>echo</code> and <code>export</code>, <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sh.html#uh-14">can be validly executed on the same line</a>, without a semi-colon separating the statements.
I found some resulting commands I tried out did not result in what I expected.</p>

<pre><code>sh-3.2$ NUMS=ONE
sh-3.2$ echo $NUMS
ONE
sh-3.2$ NUMS=&quot;$NUMS, TWO&quot; export NUMS
sh-3.2$ echo $NUMS
ONE, TWO
sh-3.2$ NUMS=&quot;$NUMS, THREE&quot; echo $NUMS
ONE, TWO
sh-3.2$ NUMS=&quot;$NUMS, THREE&quot; export NUMS; echo $NUMS
ONE, TWO, THREE
sh-3.2$ NUMS=&quot;$NUMS, FOUR&quot; echo $NUMS; export NUMS
ONE, TWO, THREE
sh-3.2$ echo $NUMS
ONE, TWO, THREE
sh-3.2$ NUMS=&quot;$NUMS, FOUR&quot;; export NUMS
sh-3.2$ echo $NUMS
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, the PATH environment variable automatically exports when setting it to a new value within a shell script:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat path.sh
#!/bin/sh

overridePATH() {
	PATH='export is not required.'
}

overridePATH
echo $PATH
$ ./path.sh
export is not required.
</code></pre>

<p>I  wanted to install a gerrit server in order to do some code review for a friend, and thought an instance on a certain cloud hosting provider could be of service.</p>

<p>I ended up realizing that I was locked out of the server instance. I had ssh access disabled for the root user, so adding my public SSH key to the provider&rsquo;s admin panel proved to be useless.</p>

<p>The provider features a web-browser-based VNC console, but with some limitations. The web-browser-based console can not handle copy-paste commands from the user&rsquo;s machine. I wasn&rsquo;t about to type my entire public RSA key out by hand.  A workaround was needed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reset root password on the remote server instance via an email authentication tool on the provider&rsquo;s host administration web-application.</li>
<li>Log in as the root user on the remote server instance via the provider&rsquo;s web-browser-based VNC console</li>
<li>Change root password (as forced by the remote server instance)</li>
<li><code># su - otheruser</code></li>
<li><code>$ mkdir ~/.ssh</code></li>
<li><code>$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh</code></li>
<li>On my local machine: <code>$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code></li>
<li>Paste the contents of <code>id_rsa.pub</code> into a Github gist</li>
<li>Copy the raw URL of the Github gist</li>
<li>Paste the raw URL of the Github gist into <a href="http://tiny.cc`s">http://tiny.cc`s</a> web interface</li>
<li>Give the tiny.cc URL a reasonable name to type, like <a href="http://tiny.cc/publickeyfoo">http://tiny.cc/publickeyfoo</a></li>
<li>In the hosting provider&rsquo;s web-browser-based VNC console: <code>$ wget -o ~/.ssh/authorized_keys http://tiny.cc/publickeyfoo</code></li>
<li><code>$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></li>
<li><code>$ exit</code> to return to the root user</li>
<li><code># sudo echo &quot;PermitRootLogin no&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/ssh_config</code></li>
<li>On my local machine, <code>$ ssh otheruser@example.com</code> (where example.com is the hostname for my remote server instance at the hosting provider).</li>
</ul>

<p>&hellip; And back in action. This would have been easier if the web-browser based VNC console wasn&rsquo;t randomly inserting control keys or otherwise locking upwhen typing all the commands!</p>

<h2><a href="index.html#1434415672">•</a> 1434415672 - 20150615</h2>

<p>While peer reviewing an article involving Git packfiles,
I found interesting usage of SHA-1 hash values.</p>

<p>Git hashes a <code>.pack</code> packfile with SHA-1 and then uses the hash value for 3 things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The hash value is as a 20-byte trailer to the <code>.pack</code> file itself for later use as a checksum.</li>
<li>The hash value is used within the file name of the <code>.pack</code> file.</li>
<li>The hash value is used within the file name of the corresponding <code>.idx</code> file.</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought the usage in filenames was interesting.</p>

<p>I wrote a small shell script to demonstrate it all:</p>

<pre><code>
#!/bin/sh

main() {
	cd $1/.git/objects/pack
	hash_value_in_filename=`ls pack-*.pack | sed 's/pack-\(.*\).pack/\1/'`
	hash_value_in_file=`tail -c 20 pack-*.pack | hexdump -ve '1/1 &quot;%.2x&quot;'`
	hash_value_of_file=`cp pack-*.pack /tmp/$$.pack &amp;&amp; \
		chmod u+w /tmp/$$.pack &amp;&amp; \
		truncate --size=-20 /tmp/$$.pack &amp;&amp; \
		sha1sum /tmp/$$.pack | cut -d' ' -f1 &amp;&amp; \
		rm /tmp/$$.pack`

	echo &quot;File names in Git pack:&quot;
	if test $hash_value_of_file = $hash_value_in_filename ; then 
		ls -1 pack-${hash_value_in_file}.*
	fi 
	echo &quot;$hash_value_in_file : SHA-1 hash value within the .pack file.&quot;
	echo &quot;$hash_value_of_file : SHA-1 hash value of the .pack file (minus the 20 byte trailer that is the previous hash.)&quot;
	echo &quot;$hash_value_in_filename : SHA-1 hash value in the filename itself.&quot;
	cd - &gt;/dev/null
}

exiterr() {
	echo &quot;usage: $0 directory_of_a_git_repository&quot;
	exit 1
}


if test $# -ne 1 ; then exiterr; fi

if test ! -d $1/.git ; then
	echo &quot;No git repository found in \&quot;$1\&quot;&quot;
	exiterr
fi

if test ! -d $1/.git/objects/pack ; then
	echo &quot;No pack directory found in git repostiory \&quot;$1\&quot;, run with a different repository.&quot;
	exiterr
fi

<p>If attempting to compile and configure an Apple IIe / Apple IIGS emulator for demo-running purposes,
something like the shell-script below will get things going for Linux on x86_64 processors.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve compiled plan9port again recently, and  ran into some errors caused by missing X libraries, both in Ubuntu and Debian.</p>

<p>There were other errors on Debian Jessie, but a mutual error on Ubuntu Precise was that the library header file X11/IntrinsicP.h could not be found.</p>

<p>The entire compilation and installation process from a  Ubuntu Precise install would be something like the following, although I&rsquo;ve not tested it and some steps may be missing:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

main() {
    # repairPackageManagerState() # only if needed.
    installBuildTools()
    installPlan9PortDependencies()

<p>This is also the first entry I&rsquo;ve made with the <a href="http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/1/sam">sam</a> editor, and I could certainly stand to read over the manual page for it again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init">init</a> very quickly.
It is the first process started at boot of a Un*x system, and runs
 as a daemon until shut down.</p>

<p>If one types <code>pstree | less</code> on some systems, one will see <code>init</code> as the root process.</p>

<p>Apparently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">systemd</a> is the name of several things:
&ldquo;systemd is not just the name of the init daemon but also refers to the entire software bundle around it&rdquo;</p>

<p>That &ldquo;software bundle&rdquo; around it, according to Wikipedia is:
- A system and service manager. (Does that mean daemons?)
- A software platform. (Also vague.)
- The glue between applications and the kernel.</p>

<p>It seems like a Bad Thing that there is lots of stuff that each do very different things,
 all under one name, or at a minimum, harder to understand and communicate about.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of the weekend resurrecting some older d3 code and building this thing:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mcdem.us/climate/c02e.html">http://www.mcdem.us/climate/c02e.html</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/aoeu/climate">http://github.com/aoeu/climate</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The color experiments were for this.
d3 makes more sense than it used to, despite I haven&rsquo;t looked at it at all in the meanwhile.</p>

<p>It was suggested to add a slider, which I think is a good idea.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pulling some data sources I&rsquo;ll transform later for a project.
I&rsquo;m naming target directories after <em>filenames</em> and paths from the source URIs.
e.g <code>~/user/repo/data/sources/example.com/path/to/archive.zip/</code> is a directory with files in it.
To reiterate, the <code>archive.zip</code> component is a <em>directory</em>, and not the actual
zip file. The contents of the directory are the extracted contents of the source zip file.</p>

<p>The idea is to have the directory be a self-documenting reference to the source file.
However, this feels like it is being clever, and not clear.
I also wonder what ill-affects it would have on an unsuspecting shell script.</p>

<p>Why is <code>origin</code> the idiomatic name for a remote repository in
 most (if not all) of the git workflows that I&rsquo;ve seen?
 Naming the only remote repository the word <code>origin</code>
 implies that the remote is the true source of the code.
 Why isn&rsquo;t a <em>local</em> repository the true source of
 the code? Why not have the remote just serve as a backup?
 Why not have <em>many</em> backups, and name your remotes things
 like <code>github</code>, <code>bitbucket</code>, <code>my-raspberry-pi</code>, or
 <code>some-repo-alex-pulls-from</code>?
 Why not push to all those remotes simultaneously, instead of one?</p>

<h2><a href="index.html#1428707143">•</a> 1428707143 - 20150410</h2>

<p>I resurrected some years-old code based in d3, which has resulted
in pursuit of time-series data in a couple specific domains.</p>

<p>The fun part, however, is colors. Lots of colors!!</p>

<p>I ported and rewrote some older golang code that calculates
colors in HSL format and dumps them on a web page for previewing:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./gencolors -num 7 -preview 
</code></pre>

<div style='text-align: center; width: 64px; height: 64px; display: inline-block; background-color: #f20c42;'>#f20c42</div>

<div style='text-align: center; width: 64px; height: 64px; display: inline-block; background-color: #f2d107;'>#f2d107</div>

<div style='text-align: center; width: 64px; height: 64px; display: inline-block; background-color: #4ef2cc;'>#4ef2cc</div>

<div style='text-align: center; width: 64px; height: 64px; display: inline-block; background-color: #0cf28f;'>#0cf28f</div>

<div style='text-align: center; width: 64px; height: 64px; display: inline-block; background-color: #0c8ff2;'>#0c8ff2</div>

<div style='text-align: center; width: 64px; height: 64px; display: inline-block; background-color: #4e0cf2;'>#4e0cf2</div>

<div style='text-align: center; width: 64px; height: 64px; display: inline-block; background-color: #f20cd1;'>#f20cd1</div>
    

<p>This lead to some digging around with how the python <code>colorsys</code> module
is implemented, and how to escape potentially unsafe CSS or HTML in
Go&rsquo;s html/template package. (Hint: supply a function map to the
template before executing.)</p>

<p>The resulting colors themselves are pretty useless.
Colors with marginally different hue settings in HSL
can have very little perceivable difference, and the
algorithms don&rsquo;t consider persons with color-blindness.
They look kind of pretty on a web page, though.</p>

<p>I found some stock color sets (&ldquo;alphabets&rdquo;) from a couple research articles
that look more promising. I&rsquo;ll add these into the library as well as
constants. There&rsquo;s not really a goal for the library other than to
document what I&rsquo;m learning as I go, and maybe provide usage for someone
else since it is open source.</p>

<p>I accidentally filled up my Chromebook hard drive pulling down docker
(with the intention of trying out the golang mobile stuff for android).
I couldn&rsquo;t log into my main user account anymore!!</p>

<p>I ended up getting in through the Guest log in, opening crosh in the browser,
and purging some bigger directories&hellip; one of them being the emacs source
( ~600mB ) and another being android-studio ( &gt; ~700mB ).  Not surprisingly,
android-studio binaries are bigger than the entire emacs git repository.
Both directories are huge. +1 for line editors.</p>

<p>I ended up getting more low-profile USB 3 drives to mitigate, which lead to
<a href="https://twitter.com/tmcdemus/status/585490679339610113">some</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/tmcdemus/status/585495257242021888">discussions</a> about
what filesystem to format the drives with.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try one of the drives out as btrfs since that&rsquo;s supported in back-ports.
Chrome OS itself will not recognize that drive, but that might be a feature.</p>

<p>ext4 is the reasonable choice - it is supported out-of-the-box on
any linux distro I can think of (and therefore is present on live-boot images).</p>

<p>Over the weekend, I wrote a simple HTTP request header and body
&ldquo;echoer&rdquo; in golang. I went through a couple refactors thanks
to Jay giving me some code review.</p>

<p>I may have found a bug in the standard libraries.</p>

<p>I ended up pulling down the Go source on another machine and doing
some experiments back and forth between the two.
I wanted to confirm that the problem wasn&rsquo;t from me running the program
on localhost. Something does seems wrong.</p>

<p>I think the next step would be searching around the code base
and see what else calls the relevant function&hellip; maybe the documentation
is wrong, or maybe my usage is wrong, or maybe there really is a bug
and this function should check for zero values and provide defaults
based on what it does next.</p>

<p>Today, I learned some security things over lunch with someone.
They were nice enough to answer a bunch of questions I had about
that part of the field. It is less of a blackbox, at least.</p>

<p>In the evening, I paired with someone on crypto exercises in golang.
That was fun and relatively productive.
We found bugs in the exercise.</p>

<p>I shared with a person that is new to golang how to use interfaces
and struct composition in Go with some code I wrote:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://play.golang.org/p/5rQ7LgR3Wl">interface example</a></li>
<li><a href="http://play.golang.org/p/orGE20_VSk">struct composition example</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like the person found it helpful.
That made me feel productive, and I can imagine what the language
must look like if you&rsquo;re coming from python and not C / C++/ J*va.
It is nice to help dispell some of the things that confused me, too.</p>

<p>I fell asleep while pulling down GCC on Arch on the Pi, but
I was able to successfully compile a program using portmidi on the Pi
this morning.</p>

<p>I was also able to cross compile a program for ARM 6 / Arch on
from a debian instance. I recompiled Go 1.5 with CGO enabled,
but I forgot that I also need some mechanism to cross compile
the C for ARM 6 / Arch also! That&rsquo;s a project for later.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned and tweaked a few things.</p>

<ul>
<li>In vim, use <code>set shell=/bin/sh</code> to set a specific shell.</li>
<li>In vim, <code>:r !./tools/timestamp</code> now creates a timestamp.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m ditching pandoc for &ldquo;blackfriday&rdquo;
-- blackfriday does just markdown to HTML conversion (do one thing and one thing well) vs. pandoc, which converts many formats to many others.
-- blackfriday is written in Go, so I currently will be able to edit it more easily than pandoc, which is written in Haskell.</li>
<li>I added a Makefile to make building a little easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>blackfriday is also the first thing I built with Go 1.5 pre-release, using
<a href="http://dave.cheney.net/2015/03/03/cross-compilation-just-got-a-whole-lot-better-in-go-1-5">Dave Cheney&rsquo;s instructions</a>
as a reference.
I just compiled and bootstrapped Go 1.5 a bit ago.
The goal is to cross compile for ARM 6 so I can run some golang
sound generating programs on the Raspberry Pi Arch Linux installation
I set up last night.</p>

<p>Earlier tonigt, bcgraham and I also got some bug fixes
and enhancements merged into
<a href="http://github.com/aoeu/mta">http://github.com/aoeu/mta</a>, and we can deployed to <a href="http://mta.today">http://mta.today</a>.

<p>I moved the markdown file from the llog repository into a github pages repostiory.<br />
I&rsquo;ve been thinking about doing something like this for a while - I gets lots of ideas of things to jot down and write, but I&rsquo;d like the simplest possible mechanisms to author and publish.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve added some complexity by relying on pandoc to generate an HTML page file from the markdown, but this seems simpler than using some of the other popular tools out there.</p>

<p>All I did was:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a repostiory on github called <code>aoeu.github.io</code></li>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/aoeu/aoeu.github.io.git</code></li>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/aoeu/llog.git</code></li>
<li><code>git remote add master master</code></li>
<li><code>git pull master master</code></li>
<li><code>ls -a llog.md</code></li>
<li><code>git remote rm master</code></li>
<li><code>pandoc -s llog.md -o index.html</code></li>
<li><code>git push origin master</code></li>
<li><code>w3m https://aoeu.github.io</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;d rather get something even simpler in place, but this setup will do for now.</p>

<p>An idiom for logging to Standard Error and exiting with error status in golang:
- <code>log.Fatal(&quot;an error explanation&quot;)</code> will log to standard error and exit.
- You can remove the &ldquo;timestamp&rdquo; prefix of the log message with <code>log.SetFlags(0)</code>
- You can set a custom prefix with <code>log.SetPrefix(someString + &quot;: &quot;)</code></p>

<p>Also, Go&rsquo;s <code>net/url.Parse</code> is just wrapping and calling <code>net/url.ParseRequestURI</code> and bypassing some of the latter&rsquo;s error checking.
(<code>ParseRequestURI</code> is intended for full URI&rsquo;s specifiying an encoding, etc.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Install crouton / i3</li>
<li>Install java, newer than version 6. Try something like:
-- <code>sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk'
--</code>sudo update-alternatives --config java`</li>
<li>Download Android Studio: <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html</a></li>
<li><code>tar xzvf android-studio-bundle-135.1339820-linux.tgz</code></li>
<li><code>cd android-studio/bin; ./studio.sh</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Waiting for Java to insall, gradle to get dependencies, and Android Studio takes some time.</p>

<p>Other light amounts of magic I required:
Set X to run from regular users: <code>
sudo ed /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config 
,s/console/anybody/
wq
</code>
For weird libstdc++6.so errors from <code>adb</code> : <code>sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6 lib32z1 lib32z1-dev</code></p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;m thinking about email hygeine.
The idea here is to remove oneself from mailing lists or other uneccessary,
noisey messages.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t thought of a great way to do this yet programatically.</p>

<p>One possible algorithm or method:
- Open your mail box.
- Go through every message for a day (or part of day).
- Click unsubscribe on noisey, unecessary mail messages.</p>

<h3>Today, I thought about primitive alternatives to <code>pbcopy</code></h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using OS X, you can move data from the terminal to the clipboard with
the <code>pbcopy</code> command.  If you have X, you can use <code>xclip</code>.</p>

<p>A way that I like better is using temporary files:
- <code>date &gt; /tmp/today.txt</code> Append some arbitrary data to a text file (instead of a clipboard).
- <code>vim some_file.txt</code> Edit an arbitrary file.
-  <code>:r /tmp/today.txt</code> Insert the data from the arbitary after the current cursorline.</p>

<p>Appending text may have been a more reasonable alternative:
<code>date &gt;&gt; some_file.txt</code></p>

<h3>Today, I decided to start a blog in markdown, even if it is just local.</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to call it a &ldquo;llog&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Today, I firewalled a new server.</h3>

<p>I mostly followed instructions here: <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/security/securing-your-server">https://www.linode.com/docs/security/securing-your-server</a>
And then I skimmed some info from the arch wiki: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/iptables">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/iptables</a></p>
