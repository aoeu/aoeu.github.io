<h1>Hello there, stranger.</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>This is a log of things I learn, experiment with, or think about.
There isn&rsquo;t an intended audience.</p>

<h2>1428497189 - 20150408</h2>

<p>I accidentally filled up my Chromebook hard drive pulling down docker
(with the intention of trying out the golang mobile stuff for android).
I couldn&rsquo;t log into my main user account anymore!!</p>

<p>I ended up getting in through the Guest log in, opening crosh in the browser,
and purging some bigger directories&hellip; one of them being the emacs source
( ~600mB ) and another being android-studio ( &gt; ~700mB ).  Not surprisingly,
android-studio binaries are bigger than the entire emacs git repository.
Both directories are huge. +1 for line editors.</p>

<p>I ended up getting more low-profile USB 3 drives to mitigate, which lead to
<a href="https://twitter.com/tmcdemus/status/585490679339610113">some</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/tmcdemus/status/585495257242021888">discussions</a> about
what filesystem to format the drives with.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try one of the drives out as btrfs since that&rsquo;s supported in back-ports.
Chrome OS itself will not recognize that drive, but that might be a feature.</p>

<p>ext4 is the reasonable choice - it is supported out-of-the-box on
any linux distro I can think of (and therefore is present on live-boot images).</p>

<h2>1428410883 - 20150407</h2>

<p>Over the weekend, I wrote a simple HTTP request header and body
&ldquo;echoer&rdquo; in golang. I went through a couple refactors thanks
to Jay giving me some code review.</p>

<p>I may have found a bug in the standard libraries.</p>

<p>I ended up pulling down the Go source on another machine and doing
some experiments back and forth between the two.
I wanted to confirm that the problem wasn&rsquo;t from me running the program
on localhost. Something does seems wrong.</p>

<p>I think the next step would be searching around the code base
and see what else calls the relevant function&hellip; maybe the documentation
is wrong, or maybe my usage is wrong, or maybe there really is a bug
and this function should check for zero values and provide defaults
based on what it does next.</p>

<h2>1428025541 - 20150402</h2>

<p>Today, I learned some security things over lunch with someone.
They were nice enough to answer a bunch of questions I had about
that part of the field. It is less of a blackbox, at least.</p>

<p>In the evening, I paired with someone on crypto exercises in golang.
That was fun and relatively productive.
We found bugs in the exercise.</p>

<p>I shared with a person that is new to golang how to use interfaces
and struct composition in Go with some code I wrote:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://play.golang.org/p/5rQ7LgR3Wl">interface example</a></li>
<li><a href="http://play.golang.org/p/orGE20_VSk">struct composition example</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like the person found it helpful.
That made me feel productive, and I can imagine what the language
must look like if you&rsquo;re coming from python and not C / C++/ J*va.
It is nice to help dispell some of the things that confused me, too.</p>

<h2>1427983169 - 20150402</h2>

<p>I fell asleep while pulling down GCC on Arch on the Pi, but
I was able to successfully compile a program using portmidi on the Pi
this morning.</p>

<p>I was also able to cross compile a program for ARM 6 / Arch on
from a debian instance. I recompiled Go 1.5 with CGO enabled,
but I forgot that I also need some mechanism to cross compile
the C for ARM 6 / Arch also! That&rsquo;s a project for later.</p>

<h2>1427944190 - 20150401</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned and tweaked a few things.</p>

<ul>
<li>In vim, use <code>set shell=/bin/sh</code> to set a specific shell.</li>
<li>In vim, <code>:r !./tools/timestamp</code> now creates a timestamp.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m ditching pandoc for &ldquo;blackfriday&rdquo;
&ndash; blackfriday does just markdown to HTML conversion (do one thing and one thing well) vs. pandoc, which converts many formats to many others.
&ndash; blackfriday is written in Go, so I currently will be able to edit it more easily than pandoc, which is written in Haskell.</li>
<li>I added a Makefile to make building a little easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>blackfriday is also the first thing I built with Go 1.5 pre-release, using
<a href="http://dave.cheney.net/2015/03/03/cross-compilation-just-got-a-whole-lot-better-in-go-1-5">Dave Cheney&rsquo;s instructions</a>
as a reference.
I just compiled and bootstrapped Go 1.5 a bit ago.
The goal is to cross compile for ARM 6 so I can run some golang
sound generating programs on the Raspberry Pi Arch Linux installation
I set up last night.</p>

<p>Earlier tonigt, bcgraham and I also got some bug fixes
and enhancements merged into
<a href="http://github.com/aoeu/mta">http://github.com/aoeu/mta</a>, and we can deployed to <a href="http://mta.today">http://mta.today</a>.
The result is pretty nice to use from <code>w3m</code> since the tables and
and everything get rendered correctly now.</p>

<h2>1427927658 - 20150401</h2>

<p>I moved the markdown file from the llog repository into a github pages repostiory.<br />
I&rsquo;ve been thinking about doing something like this for a while - I gets lots of ideas of things to jot down and write, but I&rsquo;d like the simplest possible mechanisms to author and publish.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve added some complexity by relying on pandoc to generate an HTML page file from the markdown, but this seems simpler than using some of the other popular tools out there.</p>

<p>All I did was:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a repostiory on github called <code>aoeu.github.io</code></li>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/aoeu/aoeu.github.io.git</code></li>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/aoeu/llog.git</code></li>
<li><code>git remote add master master</code></li>
<li><code>git pull master master</code></li>
<li><code>ls -a llog.md</code></li>
<li><code>git remote rm master</code></li>
<li><code>pandoc -s llog.md -o index.html</code></li>
<li><code>git push origin master</code></li>
<li><code>w3m https://aoeu.github.io</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;d rather get something even simpler in place, but this setup will do for now.</p>

<h2>1421676983 - 20150119</h2>

<p>An idiom for logging to Standard Error and exiting with error status in golang:
- <code>log.Fatal(&quot;an error explanation&quot;)</code> will log to standard error and exit.
- You can remove the &ldquo;timestamp&rdquo; prefix of the log message with <code>log.SetFlags(0)</code>
- You can set a custom prefix with <code>log.SetPrefix(someString + &quot;: &quot;)</code></p>

<p>Also, Go&rsquo;s <code>net/url.Parse</code> is just wrapping and calling <code>net/url.ParseRequestURI</code> and bypassing some of the latter&rsquo;s error checking.
(<code>ParseRequestURI</code> is intended for full URI&rsquo;s specifiying an encoding, etc.)</p>

<h2>20141026</h2>

<ul>
<li>Install crouton / i3</li>
<li>Install java, newer than version 6. Try something like:
&ndash; <code>sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk'
--</code>sudo update-alternatives &ndash;config java`</li>
<li>Download Android Studio: <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html</a></li>
<li><code>tar xzvf android-studio-bundle-135.1339820-linux.tgz</code></li>
<li><code>cd android-studio/bin; ./studio.sh</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Waiting for Java to insall, gradle to get dependencies, and Android Studio takes some time.</p>

<p>Other light amounts of magic I required:
Set X to run from regular users: <code>
sudo ed /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config 
,s/console/anybody/
wq
</code>
For weird libstdc++6.so errors from <code>adb</code> : <code>sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6 lib32z1 lib32z1-dev</code></p>

<h2>20141012</h2>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;m thinking about email hygeine.
The idea here is to remove oneself from mailing lists or other uneccessary,
noisey messages.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t thought of a great way to do this yet programatically.</p>

<p>One possible algorithm or method:
- Open your mail box.
- Go through every message for a day (or part of day).
- Click unsubscribe on noisey, unecessary mail messages.</p>

<h2>20140904 : 1409869214</h2>

<h3>Today, I thought about primitive alternatives to <code>pbcopy</code></h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using OS X, you can move data from the terminal to the clipboard with
the <code>pbcopy</code> command.  If you have X, you can use <code>xclip</code>.</p>

<p>A way that I like better is using temporary files:
- <code>date &gt; /tmp/today.txt</code> Append some arbitrary data to a text file (instead of a clipboard).
- <code>vim some_file.txt</code> Edit an arbitrary file.
-  <code>:r /tmp/today.txt</code> Insert the data from the arbitary after the current cursorline.</p>

<p>Appending text may have been a more reasonable alternative:
<code>date &gt;&gt; some_file.txt</code></p>

<h3>Today, I decided to start a blog in markdown, even if it is just local.</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to call it a &ldquo;llog&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Today, I firewalled a new server.</h3>

<p>I mostly followed instructions here: <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/security/securing-your-server">https://www.linode.com/docs/security/securing-your-server</a>
And then I skimmed some info from the arch wiki: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/iptables">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/iptables</a></p>
